<h1>MEMORY GAME</h1>
  <h4>Memory games are not only entertaining, but also stimulating for your brain. By playing you are keeping your brain active, engaged, and sharp! </h4>
  <p> Here is an excerpt from Google on the importance of mind games:<p>
  <br>
  <p class="google"><i>The purpose of these games is to improve your memory, thinking, reaction time, and cognitive ability. These games are especially important later in life to keep these factors strong. While it may seem hard to believe, by simply playing certain games you can help avoid degeneration and memory loss by continuing to work your brain and keep it sharp.Mind games are usually simple in design but have a big impact. Think of your brain like your abs. If you work out your abs you are going to develop strong abs. However, if you do not work out your abs they will lose their definition and strength. Mind games are built to work your brain to keep it sharp and alert.</i></p>
<h4>So what is there to loose? Let's play!</h4>
